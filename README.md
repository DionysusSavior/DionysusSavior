Create and live your truth: Truth is in our collective imagination. The world has secrets left to find. You will find yours. 

Bad times are inevitable, worrying is a waste of energy. Always be preparing. 
A lifestlye is a culmination of daily habits. Win the day. 
More money is not always more. Focus on marginal returns of time.
Our task is not to find the external barriers to goals but the internal barriers that prevent us from being the accomplished. 
Trust your instincts, our subconscious sees everything. 
Stay loyal to your True Cause.
